### Setup
##### GitHub

This semester you will be maintaining your own Github **repository** to backup and share your work. You'll have one folder in which all the work regarding this class will take place. Your **repository** then can be thought of as an online backup copy of that local ("on your computer") project folder. The idea is this:

As you can see above, you will be interacting with **two** repositories this semester:

- The one on the left is the one I am maintaining (it's [this one](https://github.com/leoneckert/abc-f20)). It will mainly be used for sharing code and learnings with you. Let's say you will **get** information here. 
- The other one, on the right, is your own, on your account (we will sign up further below). You will be the only person uploading files to it, all the work your produce in this class. Instead of "uploading", we will call this action "push" from now on. You make changes to your files on your computer ("local"), then push them to your "remote repository". You see, I am sliding in some terminology here that you will need to get used to.

You will need to organize your files with a lot of care this semester, but it will pay off in exciting new learnings ðŸ‘».

In the following steps, I will guide you through the setup of all this. 

###### Make a GitHub account.

This is much like setting up any other account, you will not need much help, except, let me recommend to make a student account instead of a regular one. It comes with some nice, free benefits: https://education.github.com/pack
